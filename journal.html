	Journal Entry #1: 12-1-25: Today I made my third event listener and I was hungry so I made it pasta that shows up when you click. It is my 6th project (I am a little late with the entries but from now on I will update them often).

	Journal Entry #2: (I am going backwards) For my 5th project, I made a cookie clicker wtih a rainbow cookie and I learnt how to create a scoreboard. The number rises when you click on the mouspad.

	Journal Entry #3: My 4th project was another event listener that I learnt how to do. When you type on your keyboard, the image of the bus moves across the screen!

	Journal Entry #4: My 2nd project was really cool. (I skipped projects 1 and 3 I know) I harmonized by recording 4 different times and when you click on the screen and then drag your mouse to the pink square, you can hear it.
	<p>

	Journal Entry #5: My next project was a little bit hard. Everytime you click on the square, it changes color based on wether the number clicked is even or odd. This is an event listener. You set clicks to 0, the original number, and then set the clicks +1 so it adds a number everytime clicked and the color changes.

	Journal Entry #6: This project was an end of season holiday card! It was an event listener. Everytime you click, a picture pops up. Of my table! And when you click at the end, they all disappear. How I did this, is I made a click function event listener under script, and I did many if statements linked to divs. Above, under style, I made a div for how the images should all look, and then I did # to call to the div for each image.

	Journal Entry #7: This project was the second I made coming back from break. The first was a random generator Jocelyn and I made for our free. This one was a screen that automatically changes color so it is like a rainbow. I did this by adding a changeColor function and using RGB to control the different colors.
