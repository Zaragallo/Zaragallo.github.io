	Journal Entry #1: 12-1-25: Today I made my third event listener and I was hungry so I made it pasta that shows up when you click. It is my 6th project (I am a little late with the entries but from now on I will update them often).

	Journal Entry #2: (I am going backwards) For my 5th project, I made a cookie clicker wtih a rainbow cookie and I learnt how to create a scoreboard. The number rises when you click on the mouspad.

	Journal Entry #3: My 4th project was another event listener that I learnt how to do. When you type on your keyboard, the image of the bus moves across the screen!

	Journal Entry #4: My 2nd project was really cool. (I skipped projects 1 and 3 I know) I harmonized by recording 4 different times and when you click on the screen and then drag your mouse to the pink square, you can hear it.
